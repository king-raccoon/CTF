> We can calculate the volume of the fundamental domain from the basis vectors. As an example, let us take a two dimensional lattice with basis vectors `v = (2,5), u = (3,1)`. Create a matrix `A` with rows corresponding to the basis vectors: `A = [[2,5],[3,1]]`. The volume of the fundamental domain is the magnitude of the determinant of A: `Vol(F) = |det(A)| = |2*1 - 5*3| = |-13| = 13`.
